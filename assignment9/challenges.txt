Task: Scraping OWASP Top 10 (2021)

Challenges faced:
1. The official OWASP "Top 10" page (https://owasp.org/Top10/) didn't list all links in a structured way that could be scraped directly.
2. Some expected URLs like "https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery/" led to a 404 error.
3. The final A10 link used a different format: "https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/" â€” it required manual inspection to find.
4. Some descriptions were not found under <p> tags as expected, so a fallback CSS selector had to be used.
5. CSV output formatting needed tuning for better readability.

Solutions:
- Used a hardcoded list of URLs with verified working links.
- Added error handling and printed debug info for failures.
- Used sleep() to allow pages to fully load.
- Used pandas with encoding="utf-8-sig" and semicolon delimiter for readable CSV.

The final code now successfully extracts title, link, and description for all Top 10 vulnerabilities from OWASP 2021 and writes to owasp_top_10.csv.
