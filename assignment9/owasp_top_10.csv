"A01:2021 – Broken Access Control";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/";"Moving up from the fifth position, 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control with the average incidence rate of 3.81%, and has the most occurrences in the contributed dataset with over 318k. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data, and CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery."
"A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/";"Shifting up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which is more of a broad symptom rather than a root cause, the focus is on failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof). Which often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, CWE-327: Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm, and CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy."
"A03:2021 – Injection";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/";"Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3%, and 274k occurrences. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting, CWE-89: SQL Injection, and CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path."
"A04:2021 – Insecure Design";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/";"A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures. As a community we need to move beyond ""shift-left"" in the coding space to pre-code activities that are critical for the principles of Secure by Design. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) include CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials, CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation, and CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials."
"A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/";"Moving up from #6 in the previous edition, 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.%, and over 208k occurrences of a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) in this risk category. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it's not surprising to see this category move up. Notable CWEs included are CWE-16 Configuration and CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference."
"A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/";"It was #2 from the Top 10 community survey but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data. Vulnerable Components are a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk and is the only category to not have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploits/impact weight of 5.0 is used. Notable CWEs included are CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components and the two CWEs from Top 10 2013 and 2017."
"A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/";"Previously known as Broken Authentication, this category slid down from the second position and now includes Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) related to identification failures. Notable CWEs included are CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch, CWE-287: Improper Authentication, and CWE-384: Session Fixation."
"A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/";"A new category for 2021 focuses on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) include CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere, CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check, and CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data."
"A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/";"Security logging and monitoring came from the Top 10 community survey (#3), up slightly from the tenth position in the OWASP Top 10 2017. Logging and monitoring can be challenging to test, often involving interviews or asking if attacks were detected during a penetration test. There isn't much CVE/CVSS data for this category, but detecting and responding to breaches is critical. Still, it can be very impactful for accountability, visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. This category expands beyond CWE-778 Insufficient Logging to include CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, CWE-223 Omission of Security-relevant Information, and CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File."
"A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)";"https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/";"This category is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage and above-average Exploit and Impact potential ratings. As new entries are likely to be a single or small cluster of Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) for attention and awareness, the hope is that they are subject to focus and can be rolled into a larger category in a future edition."
